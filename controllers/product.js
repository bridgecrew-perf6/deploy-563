const Product = require("../models/product");
const formidable = require("formidable");
const _ = require("lodash"); // _ this is a private stuff that if we have a variable but dont want to use it too much explicitly
const fs = require("fs"); //whenever user shows this is my file and here it is located we need to access that path so we need install filesystem as well it comes as default so do not need to npm install it

/*The only reason we want to use form data is that we have some multipart or binary files (if we
  like that user should some pdf doc or jpeg image or mp3)for this we prefer form data. I can use 
  form data for name,email,password as well but json response makes more sense to process these things
  further.So since in product we will be fetching up the tshirts photo as well that is why we are processing 
  form data.
  Why Lodash?
  =>Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
  =>Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

     Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
     Manipulating & testing values
     Creating composite functions

/*product listing
 .select(-photo) :dont select the photo, .limit(limit): limit variable passed in limit method to show no. of products as 8 only
req.query : whenever there is a ? there is a query fired. Passing a limit object using query. So if there is query from front end
and has a property for .limit use ?____: this one else ? : ____ this one
Whenever u take any parameter from user major languages handle it as a string java,js becuase this is the way these languages are architectured.
so we wrap this query parameter and convert it to no. using parseInt(req.query.limit) , .sort : we can sort it on creation date,how many sold etc.
here we have sorted on ascending order. examples: Product.find().sort([['updatedAt','descending']]) or .sort([[sortBy, "asc"]]).Now same as limit we 
provide a default value if there is no query for that let sortBy = req.query.sortBy ? req.query.sortBy : "_id"; if not given sort on base of id's 
So thats your getAllProducts which is configurable from frontend so like in some section i want products to be sort based on creation date in some
other section I want it to be sort based on no. of products sold and if not defined then It will automatically sorted on id's.
